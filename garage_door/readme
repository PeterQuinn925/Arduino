The app is 

Main.py is python code for Raspberry pi pico
ble_advertising.py defines some useful functions

I can't remember where I got the base code. I didn't write most of this code.

Connect COM and ON on relay to the switch wires on the garage door opener

.aia is the App Inventor project
.apk is the app itself
